Notes
What could be better:
1) prepare data before pass to list adapters. Should create data models for remote and view, map fiels such as dates, which are
retrieved as ISO strings
2) activity should not prepare toolbar for each fragments, but fragments have to tell activity how to represent toolbar
3) no common navigation, should be used backStack or nav component
